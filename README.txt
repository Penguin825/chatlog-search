    This software is for windows and will not work on other operating systems.
    To run it, double click ChatlogSearch_1_4.exe.

    The program has a few settings that you can change. Open search_config.ini
    to change these. The settings are as follows:

    use regex:
        By changing this to "on", the program will run in regex mode. This
        allows you to make more complex searches using regex matching.

    debug:
        When turned on, the program will output status updates while running.
        It will also prompt you to press enter before viewing the results.

    logs folder:
        This is the location of your logs folder. You can change this to
        search files in other locations.

        DISCLAIMER: The software will search EVERY .log file and .gz file
        in the given folder! If you have .log files or .gz files that aren't
        from minecraft logs it will still show results from these files!
